## Set up a minimal workstation to use this repo

### Prerequisites

- Having [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed

### Useful softwares

#### Node.js

![Node.js logo](./assets/images/nodejs_logo.png)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on the Google Chrome [V8 engine](https://v8.dev/).

To install it properly, I suggest you use NVM (Node Version Manager), which, as its name suggests, will simplify your life to manage several versions of Node.js on your computer.

- **Link for Windows users:** [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades)
- **Link for UNIX or macOS users:** [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Once NVM is installed, open a terminal and run the following commands, replacing `<X.Y.Z>` with the version you want:
```
$ nvm install <X.Y.Z>
$ nvm use <X.Y.Z>
```

Now you have version `<X.Y.Z>` of Node.js installed and used on your computer. If you need another one in the future, you can run the commands `nvm install` (to install a new version) and `nvm use` (to use a particular one). To list the different versions available on your computer, you can run the `nvm ls` command. An asterisk will be present next to the version in use.

#### Visual Studio Code

![VS Code logo](./assets/images/vs_code_logo.png)

VS Code is an extensible code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It is one of the most widely used IDEs in the JS ecosystem.

### Troubleshooting

- Check that your `nvm` version is recent (>= 1.1.9)
- If you have problems with Node and `npm` dependencies installation, check that `nvm ls` and `node -v` return the same version numbers. Delete the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` folder properly before starting a new installation from scratch. Another point of attention, especially when switching from an old version of Node to a recent one on Windows, make sure to delete the cache of the `C:\Users\_\AppData\Local\node-gyp` folder.

## Getting started

Clone the repo on your computer using the following Git command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ehenon/quiz-answer-validator.git
```

Open the project via your IDE and open a terminal (for example using `Ctrl+Shift+Ã¹` on VS Code).

Checkout the `main` branch:

```
$ git checkout main
```

Install the dependencies of the project:

```
$ npm install
```

Then you can run some available commands:

```
$ npm run lint            // run the linter
$ npm run test            // run the unit tests
$ npm run build           // build in a lib folder
```

## Repo structure

The repo is structured into different folders:

### Root

At the root of the repo, you can find:

- `.commitlintrc.json`: commitlint config file
- `.eslintignore`: config file to tell ESLint to ignore specific files and directories
- `.eslintrc`: ESLint rules config file
- `.gitignore`: config file to tell Git to ignore specific files and directories
- `.huskyrc`: husky config file for Git hooks
- `CODEOWNERS`: file which defines people who are responsible for the codebase
- `CHANGELOG.md`: file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of the project
- `DEVELOPERS.md`: guide for developers
- `jest.config.ts`: config file for Jest testing framework
- `LICENSE`: file specifying the license
- `package-lock.json`: file automatically generated for any operations where `npm` modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json` (please note that this file must be committed)
- `package.json`: ~ID card for the Node project, contains name, version, scripts, dependencies etc.
- `README.md`: main README file of the repository  

### `.github`

The `.github` directory contains:
- `.md` files serving as GitHub templates (especially for issues and pull requests)
- a `workflows` directory containing the different [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflows (see the [CI/CD](#cicd-and-release-management) section for more details)

### `assets`

The `assets` directory contains some images used for the documentation.

### `configs`

The `configs` directory contains config files for TypeScript transpilation:
- `tsconfig.base.json`: common compilation settings that can be used regardless of which module format we are targeting
- `tsconfig.cjs.json`: specific settings for CommonJS format
- `tsconfig.eslint.json`: specific settings for ESLint
- `tsconfig.esm.json`: specific settings for ECMAScript format

### `coverage`

The `coverage` directory is the report output directory used by Jest for the code coverage part. When you run the unit tests locally, you can find the coverage report as a static site at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

Please note that this directory is not versioned.

### `lib`

The `lib` directory is the build target of the project. It is filled by the `npm run build` command.

Please note that this directory is not versioned.

### `node_modules`

The `node_modules` directory contains all locally installed npm dependencies and sub-dependencies.

Please note that this directory is not versioned.

### `src`

The `src` directory contains all the source files of the project. NB: it includes the `.spec.ts` unit tests files.

## Development conventions

### Code and quality gate

Some conventions:
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Encoding: UTF-8
- EoL Sequence: CRLF

Quality gate:
- Audit for vulnerabilities (using [audit-ci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audit-ci))
- ESLint (using [AirBnB](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) style)
- Unit tests (performed using [Jest framework](https://jestjs.io/))
- Build

### Git branching pattern

This project adopts a simple 2-level branching pattern with:
- `main` being the default branch, symbolizing the latest released version
  - `feat/_` being the branches created from `main` to work on the features of the future release
  - `fix/_` being the branches created from `main` to work on the fixes of the future release

### Working on a new task

When you work on a new task, you have to create a new `feat/_` or `fix/_` branch from the `main` branch. The name of the branch in question must start with the GitHub Issue number associated with the task, followed by a few keywords related to this task (example: `feat/142-add-mongodb-service`).

Once this branch is created, you can work on it and create a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch and respecting the Pull Request template set up on the project. This Pull Request will be used as a basis to follow the progress of the task in question (history of commits, quality gate, reviews, link with GitHub Issue number etc).

Please note that a Pull Request should only be submitted for human review if you consider your work to be complete, tested, successful, and if the automatic quality gate has passed.

### Commit conventions

Concerning the commits standards, please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## CI/CD and release management

A single `CHANGELOG.md` file is available at the root of the project. Its format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

On this repo, we have 2 [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) CI/CD workflows, which you can find in `.github/workflows` folder:
- `quality-gate.yml`: Launched automatically on the `main` branch and on any Pull Request targeting it, this workflow mainly checks the quality of the code (audit for vulnerabilities, lint, unit tests) and its build
- `release.yml`: Launched automatically on the `main` branch when the quality gate passes, this workflow creates a new release. Thanks to [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it takes care of bumping the version, creating a tag and a GitHub release, and publishing it to the [public npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).
